        <p style="color:white;">
            Creating Total Annihilation maps can take awhile. That's why we want to add a random map generator app
            within Arm Prime. Users will be able to select their desired map tileset they'd like to play on and generate
            it within seconds. It would be very interesting to see randomly generated maps with a massive map size as a
            parameter.
			
            The random map generator will begin development as soon as Lazarus is polished and in satisfactoy shape. The
            biggest challenge of this feature will be figuring out how to read the .TNT file extensions created by
            Cavedog Entertainment.

        <p>
            There is a way to tap into the Total Annihilation game engine that gives you more control to make very heavy
            and specific modifications to AI behavior. This can be done by playing a "Skirmish" game through the
            campaign mode, and taking advantage of "Initial Mission Commands". Thanks to the documentation hosted on TA Universe, we can see that making modifications to the OTA file will
            give us the ability to greatly improve the AI players:

			<p>
Most missions created do not rely on the AI to handle the battle, rather, everything is carefully planned
            ahead. Having units wait until they are attacked, having groups of units attack at the same time, having
            them target specific units, even roving patrols, are all commands that are set here. Giving all (or most) of
            your enemy units a series of commands that interact and mesh to make an appropriate defense (and offense) is
            what mission creation is all about. If a Unit is given no initial commands, or runs out of commands, the AI
            will take over, if it is a Computer controlled Unit (anything other than Player 1). If it is a Player
            controlled Unit and you want the Player to be able to interrupt the initial commands, insert a "s" (to make
            it selectable) in the initial command list.Most missions created do not rely on the AI to handle the battle, rather, everything is carefully planned

            Arm Prime will scan/analyze your desired map, and can either automatically generate initial commands or
            allow you to customize the AI initial conditions manually. This AI generator will most likely be written in Python
			and be an open source project.
