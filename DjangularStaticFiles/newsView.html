                            <p>
                                What began as a conflict over the transfer of consciousness from flesh to machines escalated into a war

                                which has decimated a million worlds. The Core and the Arm have all but exhausted the resources of a galaxy in their struggle for domination.

                                Both sides now crippled beyond repair, the remnants of their armies continue to battle on ravaged planets, their hatred fueled by over four thousand years of total war.

                                This is a fight to the death. For each side, the only acceptable outcome is the complete elimination of the other.

                            TA Lazarus is a new and powerful web based application which allows you to build highly customizable mods for Total Annihilation. As of right now, only Vanilla Total Annihilation is fully supported,

                            although it is close to being able to coexist with other already massive TA mods such as The Pack and TAESC.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            One of the biggest features of Total Annihilation Lazarus is automatic conflict crushing. Finally, you will have the ability to add a vast amount of units to

                            your Total Annihilation installation without worrying about unit command card conflicts as seen below.
