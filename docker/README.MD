# INSTALLING THE FULL STACK 

#### Installation Methods
    1. All-In-One (easier)
    2. Dedicated Servers (better performance)

If you want to deploy a full krogoth stack immediately with all included features,
just run the command below and wait for the images to finish downloading. 

### Krogoth All-In-One
##### docker required

Run `install_all_in_one.py` and follow the prompt's instructions:
```bash
$ python3 install_all_in_one.py
```

all-in-one is ideal if you'd just like to install everything now and get 
started right away.
