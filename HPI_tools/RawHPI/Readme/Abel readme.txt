To properly use the Abel you need to add these lines to the moveinfo.tdf in your totala\gamedata folder.  If you have more than 14 movement classes already, just add them and change the numbers to the next available one.

Designed by a crazy Arm Scientist who had something go wrong with his cloning procedure, this ship was originally promised to be able to annhilate entire Core bases from the safety of the open water.  After testing it was found to be severly lacking in an important aspect: It's targetting computer.
