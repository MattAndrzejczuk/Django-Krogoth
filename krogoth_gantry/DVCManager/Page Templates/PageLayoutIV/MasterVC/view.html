                                Maverix is a maccish bootstrap theme and application boilerplate. It gives your
                                web-apps a
                                native look and feel and bundles.

                                <h3>Non Responsive (for now...)</h3>

                                <p>Desktop Apps don't need to run on thousands of different devices and
                                    viewports. You are the master of setting a minimum-viewport and the app won't
                                    get smaller

                                    using Maverix Theme in a traditional web-app it is also okay for Admin Backends

                                <h3>Built on Bootstrap and Less</h3>

                                <p>Twitters Bootstrap comes bundled with tons of useful styles and add ons and
                                    allows beginners and masters to get started quickly (grid positioning, etc.).
                                    The maverix
                                    styles
                                    are

                                <h3>Webkit first</h3>

                                <p>
                                    Maverix Theme is primarily made to enable app container based web-apps to look
                                    like native
                                    OS X
                                    Apps.
                                    So webkit is the primary engine when releasing new components. However this
                                    doesn't mean
                                    that
                                    other
                                    browsers
                                    are totally unsupported. Maverix Theme is tested on Safari, Firefox and Chrome
                                    on OS X.
                                </p>

                            to
                            climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven
                            of us
                            survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking
                            now. We
                            said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal
                            but it
                            doesn't hold a candle to man. </p>

                        <p>Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull
                            this
                            shit while I'm in a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But
                            I can't
                            give you this case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much
                            shit this
                            morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass. </p>

                        <h2>Is she dead, yes or no?</h2>
                        <p>Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then
                            they show
                            that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide
                            if
                            they're going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs.
                            Some
                            don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing. </p>

                        <p>Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt
                            with my
                            name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face
                            sitting
                            outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well,
                            that's
                            what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're
                            here
                            shopping for an infant named Jeb. </p>

                        <h2>Uuummmm, this is a tasty burger!</h2>
                        <p>My money's in that office, right? If she start giving me some bullshit about it ain't
                            there, and
                            we got to go someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the head then and there.
                            Then I'm
                            gonna shoot that bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She gonna
                            tell me
                            too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there,
                            and that
                            nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first motherfucker to get shot. You
                            understand? </p>
