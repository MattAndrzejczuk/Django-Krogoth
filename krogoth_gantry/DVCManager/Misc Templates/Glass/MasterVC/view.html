<p>Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun in
    American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that comes with it: the most

<h1>THIS IS USING GLOBAL FROSTED GLASS ! ! ! !</h1>
<p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.
    Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he
    is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance
    and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord
    when I lay My vengeance upon thee. </p>

<p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world
    once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly
    when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out.
    Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two,
    but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man. </p>

<p>Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the
    people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more shows.
    Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the
    ones that became nothing. </p>
