    attackrunlength	            For planes. The distance they must travel before being able to drop their bombs/shoot their missiles. HoverAttack is like attackrunlength=0, I think
    BMcode	                    A BMcode. Every unit has a value of 1, except for contstruction plants (eg. Air Craft Plant, Vehical Plants). So do likewise.
    BadTargetCategory	        The type of target that is not good for that low accuracy at this type of unit. In general. The value specified identifies all units that have that value specified in their own "Category" settings.

    cantbetransported	        Is this a unit that transports cannot load eg. Ships, krogoth
    Category	                A category class. Look at some of the FBI files in totala1.hpi for examples. Essentially, this places the unit in several named catagories that can be named in other variables such as "wpri_badTargetCategory" described below, and in the AI Text files as well.
    CloakCost	                The energy cost of this unit remaining cloaked when standing still.
    CloakCostMoving 	        The energy cost of this unit remaining cloaking while moving.
    Commander	                Is this unit the (a?) commander.
    Copyright	                The copyright of this unit. Must be as shown to the right, or won't work. (Most people copy this line as a comment, and put their own copyright infomation in the commented-out version.
    Corpse	                    The name of the feature the unit turns into when the unit dies. If the unit is a feature (Dragons Teeth) the unit instantly turns into this feature, when it is finished being built. (this is not the 3do file of the feature, the feature entry tells the 3do file to use in the feautres OBJECT variable).
    cruisealt	                The altitude at which the unit flys
    DamageModifier	            The rate at which this unit heals itself.

    digger	                    Does this unit have pieces which extend under ground. I think thats what it means. Things like the pop-up heavy cannon have this = 1.
    Downloadable	            Is this a unit which has been downloaded off the internet. If you want to be able to use the unit, put 1.
                                (12/28/98) Note from The Raptor: Not true. I haven't included this variable in all of my units, and they work just fine. It's just one that we started seeing in the Cavedog weekly units, so assumed that's what it meant. It really seems to do nothing.
    EnergyMake	                The energy this unit produces when ACTIVE.
    EnergyStorage	            The amount added to the maximum amount of energy you can store while the unit is alive.
    EnergyUse	                The amount of energy the unit uses while it is ACTIVE.
    ExplodeAs	                The explosion ID of the explosion that will happen if the unit explodes. See totala1.hpi for other examples.
    ExtractsMetal	            The rate at which the unit extracts metal. (Yes, the MOHOmine only extracts at like 0.01)
    firestandorders	            Can this unit give firestandorders. You know as much as me.
    Floater	                    Does this unit float on water.
    FootprintX	                The X axis footprint. Should correlate with the unit model's actual size. The footprint helps control how close units can get to one another.
    FootprintZ	                As with FootprintX, but the Z axis (ie. up and down on the screen while playing TA). Should correlate with the unit model's actual size.

    MinWaterDepth	            The minimum depth of water this unit can be in	MinWaterDepth=8;
    MobileStandOrders	        Basically, I think, can this unit hold position of all mobile units, only the transports (all of them) have this equal to 0.	MobileStandOrders=1;
    MoveRate1	                Planes seem to use this. For example, all planes except the air transports have values of 8, the transports have values of 1.	MoveRate1=1;

    MovementClass	            How the unit moves. See totala1.hpi for examples. Movement classes are typically described in TDF files in the gamedata directory. (The moveinfo.tdf file is a good guess). It is used as a shortcut way of setting certain parameters (such as those listed here) by grouping them and giving them a name.

    Side	                    Which side does the unit belong to ARM, CORE.
    SightDistance	            The distance from the unit that everything is shown in. ie. Distance it gets rid of Fog of War. Unfortunately, this value seems to have a limit of around 400.
    SonarDistance	            The distance given to you as sonar, on the mini map.
    SonarDistanceJam	        This is how far the unit jams sonar on the mini map.
    sortbias
    SoundCategory	            The "sound category" the unit uses. Sound categories are typically described in TDF files in the gamedata directory. (The sounds.tdf file is a good place to start). It is used to describe a group of sounds to associate with a unit, such as what sounds does it make when it starts, stops, arrives at a destination, is activated, is deactivated, etc.
    SpanishDescription	        As description, in Spanish.	SpanishDescription=VehÃ­culo todoterreno de ataque;
    SpanishName	                As Name, but in Spanish	SpanishName=Zipper;

    SteeringMode	            The way in which the unit turns. See totala1.hpi for options.
    TEDClass	                Important...I think. Define what type of unit it is.
    teleporter	                Is this unit a teleporter. The two galatic gates have this = 1.
    ThreeD	                    Is the unit 3D.

    TurnRate	                How quickly the unit turns.	TurnRate=999;
    UnitName	                This is the name of your unit, (what I refer to as the "short name" and the name your files you decided on. e.g.. your file in this case would be called coralpha.fbi.	UnitName=CORWIN;
    UnitNumber	                The ID# for the unit. If this is the same as some other unit, your unit may not work. VERY IMPORTANT. All IDs from 0-about 400 have been used. Use other ones > 10000 is the best. The more digits, the more unlikely you'll have a ID conflict with someone else.	UnitNumber=9;
    Upright	                    Is the unit upright? For kbots - this keeps the unit upgright when climbing hills. In my case for a flying unit, my unit "layed down" on the ground whenever it landed (air unit). By setting upright=1, it solved my problem.	Upright=1;
    Version	                    The version of TA the unit will work under. Set this to 1.	Version=1;
    WaterLine	                How high up the 3d model to put the water line. For ships.	WaterLine=43;
    Weapon1	                    The unit's primary weapon. The name specified is the name of a weapon described in any of the number of TDF files found in the weapon subdirectories.	Weapon1=crblmssl;
    Weapon2	                    The unit's secondary weapon. The name specified is the name of a weapon described in any of the number of TDF files found in the weapon subdirectories.	Weapon2=coramph_weapon2;
    Weapon3	                    The unit's third weapon. The name specified is the name of a weapon described in any of the number of TDF files found in the weapon subdirectories.	Weapon3=CORSEAP_WEAPON3;
    WindGenerator	            The amount of energy generated by the wind by the unit.	WindGenerator=30;
    WorkerTime	                How quickly the unit nanolathes.	WorkerTime=80;
    wpri_badTargetCategory	    A bad target (lower chance of hitting) for the primary weapon. The value specified identifies all units that have that value specified in their own "Category" settings.	wpri_badTargetCategory=VTOL;

    YardMap	                    Defines in more detail the "footprint" of a construction yard (or any stationary building). As an example, the ARM Adv. Air Plant data at the right has 6 groups of 7 values defining an X-Z coordinate "footprint" for the construction yard. The following values are available:
