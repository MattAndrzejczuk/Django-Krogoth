Websockets Documentation
<br>
<br>
Client side:

Typing:

Each time the client begins typing, the client should publish a message upstream, to the websocket, every 2.5 seconds with the following payload:
<pre>
{
    "type": "action",
    "action": "typing"
}
</pre>
The websocket server parses each response and assigns the requesting user to each request.

When the user has finished typing, but HAS NOT sent a message, the server will respond with a typing expiration message after 3 seconds.

IF HOWEVER, the user has sent a message before a typing expiration is established, the client will need to send the following payload upstream to the
websocket to let the websocket server know that a message has been sent. This will consequentally send a typing expiration from the server back to all clients. This message can be sent on every send payload.
<pre>
{
    "type": "action",
    "action": "message sent"
}
</pre>

Server Side:

When a client is typing, the server will respond on the websocket with the following payload:
<pre>
{
    "action": "started",
    "user": "domin",
    "facility": "US~CA~Santa|Clara|County~University|South#General",
    "type": "typing",
    "message": "domin is typing",
    "data": "action"
}
</pre>
When the user has stopped typing, the server will respond with  the following payload:
<pre>
{
    "action": "stopped",
    "user": "dom",
    "facility": "US~CA~Santa|Clara|County~University|South#General",
    "type": "typing",
    "message": "dom stopped typing",
    "data": "action"
}
</pre>
When a user has joined a channel,  the server will respond with  the following payload:
<pre>
{
    "action": "joined",
    "user": "domin",
    "facility": "US~CA~Santa|Clara|County~University|South#General",
    "type": "chatroom",
    "message": "domin has joined the channel",
    "data": "action"
}
</pre>
When a user has left a channel,  the server will respond with  the following payload:
<pre>
{
    "action": "left",
    "user": "domin",
    "facility": "US~CA~Santa|Clara|County~University|South#General",
    "type": "chatroom",
    "message": "domin has left the channel",
    "data": "action"
}
</pre>
The server will also send a payload message about the channel the user is currently logged into, which is a list of users in the channel. The server
will respond with this message, each time a user joins or leaves a channel, such that the client can update its list of current users:
<pre>
{
    "facility": "US~CA~Santa|Clara|County~University|South#General",
    "type": "chatroom-list",
    "data": [
        {
            "user": "DickHead"
        },
        {
            "user": "dom"
        },
        {
            "user": "domin"
        }
    ]
}
</pre>
