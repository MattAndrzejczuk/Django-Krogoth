// This is version 3.0 of Hex80 AI

// This ai fights at an advanced level.  It was designed specifically for
// advanced TA players, especially on larger maps, who found little challenge
// once a decent base was setup.  Be warned.

// This AI is largely based upon advice from TA:MEDICS, and other ai's I've
// examined, especially DemonAI.

// This AI is EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO BEAT, EVEN WITH A POWERFUL, ESTABLISHED
// BASE.  I repeat, THIS AI IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT.  It is more challenging 
// than any other ai I have tested.  I used to let my machine run all night
// to test ai's and see if they could crack my base while I wasn't paying
// attention.  Any REASONABLY competent ai should be capable of doing this.

// !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

// My ai is the only one yet that can.  Other designers should be ashamed
// of themselves.  If your ai can't win while I sleep for 10 hours, then
// it's not an opponent, it's an observer.
 
// Remove any entries from your cavedog\totala\ai directory, rename the
// will.ai file to default.txt and place it in that directory.  Generally
// speaking, most maps will then take advantage of it.  If you know that
// another ai file is being used, simply rename default.txt to metal.txt,
// etc.(whatever ai you believe is being used)

// This ai was NOT designed for sea battles, but should function well on
// most maps given relatively clear terrain, including metal maps.
// This ai was designed to use TA:CC and a variety of downloadable units,
// in particular the excellent units from TADD.
