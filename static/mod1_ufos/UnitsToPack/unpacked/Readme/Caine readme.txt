To properly use the Caine you need to add these lines to the moveinfo.tdf in your totala\gamedata folder.  If you have more than 14 movement classes already, just add them and change the numbers to the next available one.

[CLASS16]
	{
	Name=Caine;
	FootprintX=2;
	FootprintZ=6;
	MinWaterDepth=26;
	}

Shortly after the Abel went into service, the Central Consciousness was outraged and immediately designed a *Superior* version.  The Caine has longer ranged weapons that deal more damage, but also costs far more.

The Caine was created by Mad_Bovine to be distributed by Central Consciousness and can be found at http://cc.tauniverse.com/
